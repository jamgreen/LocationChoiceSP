This is a repository for a project analysing residential location choice with a revealed preference survey from Metro, PDX's regional government. This particular project is an offshoot of that work and an attempt to start and work through a project in a more efficient way using github as the main repository of my essential documents. 

First steps: get this repo up and running and shared with Prof. Wang, and make a little annotated bibliography from which we can build out the literature and get to writing.
